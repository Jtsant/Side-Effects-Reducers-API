## Day 31  
After more practice with useReducer i will be using and testing the React Context (API). After working out with context.Consumer a more elegant way to write my code is by using the useContext hook. I will also make my context dynamic and see more examples of when to use props or context with useContext. After taking note of the Context Limitations ![Screenshot_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90603989/174133976-c64a8732-1244-43af-94ce-6e06ce992902.png)
